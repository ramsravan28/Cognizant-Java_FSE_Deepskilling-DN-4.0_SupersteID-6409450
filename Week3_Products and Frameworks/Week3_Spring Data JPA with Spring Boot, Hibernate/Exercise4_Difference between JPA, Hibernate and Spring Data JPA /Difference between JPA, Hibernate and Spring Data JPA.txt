Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification that defines how Java objects interact with relational databases. It does not provide any implementation but only outlines the standard set of rules and annotations (like @Entity, @Id, and EntityManager) for object-relational mapping (ORM). To use JPA, a concrete implementation is required â€” and that's where Hibernate comes in.

Hibernate is a popular ORM framework that implements the JPA specification. It offers many additional features such as caching, lazy loading, and HQL (Hibernate Query Language), going beyond what JPA defines. Hibernate can be used directly without JPA, using its own APIs like Session, Transaction, and SessionFactory, but it also serves as the underlying engine when JPA is used in most applications.

Spring Data JPA is a part of the Spring ecosystem and acts as a higher-level abstraction over JPA (and its implementation like Hibernate). It significantly reduces boilerplate code by providing repository interfaces such as JpaRepository and CrudRepository, which automatically generate the required queries based on method names. It integrates tightly with Spring Boot, manages transactions automatically using annotations like @Transactional, and simplifies database interaction to a great extent. While JPA provides the standard, and Hibernate implements it, Spring Data JPA builds on both to make development faster and easier.
